{"name":"zipfile","version":"0.2.0","description":"Provides a resource for extracting zip files","long_description":"# zipfile\n\nAn LWRP for extracting zip files.\n\n## Platforms\n\nThis is implemented in pure ruby, so it should run anywhere.\n\nIts tests are run on CentOS and Windows.\n\n## Resources\n\n### zipfile\n\n`zipfile` provides a resource for extracting zip files.\n\n#### Actions\n\n  * `:extract` - extract a zip file; default action\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n\nSince `zipfile` will eventually support both creating and extracting zip files, its attributes are\nessentially \"input\" and \"output\".\n\n  * `from` - source for extraction; name attribute\n  * `into` - destination for extraction\n  * `overwrite` - whether to overwrite existing files\n\n#### Examples\n\nExtract `/tmp/my_stuff.zip` into the directory `/tmp/my_stuff`:\n\n```ruby\nzipfile '/my/my_stuff.zip' do\n  into '/tmp/my_stuff'\nend\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you wish to contribute, please update the chefspec and kitchen tests to reflect your changes.\n\n### Tests\n\nThis cookbook has unit and integration tests to verify its functionality. Since `zipfile` has no recipes, the tests\nuse a testing cookbook that uses the `zipfile` resource.\n\n### Running unit tests\n\n```\n$ bundle install\n$ rake chefspec\n```\n\n### Running integration tests\n\nThe integration tests depend upon a particular zip file. It may be created by running the `package` rake task. If you\nuse the rake tasks to run Test Kitchen, it will take care of this for you.\n\n```\n$ rake test\n```\n\nThe tests expect the content of the spec file to be the same as the file in the `pkg` directory, so any spec changes\nmust be followed by re-provisioning the VM.\n\n## License\n\n```\nCopyright 2015-2017 Benjamin Jansen\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Ben Jansen","maintainer_email":"aogail@w007.org","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/aogail/chef-zipfile","issues_url":"https://github.com/aogail/chef-zipfile/issues","chef_version":[],"ohai_version":[]}
